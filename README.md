LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

###To Start
Choose from one of these 4 LIRI commands:

1) `my-tweets` will display the most recent 20 tweets from [@playoffTimeNBA](https://twitter.com/playoffTimeNBA).
  > To interact with LIRI in the command line, simply type `node liri.js my-tweets` 
 
2) `spotify-this-song` will display the artist, track, album name, and a link to a 30 second preview of the song.
  > To look up a track on Spotify, simply type `node liri.js spotify-this-song <track name>`

 * `movie-this`
 * `do-what-it-says`
